Reinventing Media Discovery with AI


## 🎯 The Challenge

Every night, millions of people spend 30–45 minutes just deciding what to watch.

Not watching.
Not relaxing.
Not learning.

Choosing.

The problem is not content scarcity — it’s decision overload caused by fragmented platforms.

## 🌀 The Problem: Doom Scrolling

<img width="600" height="600" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 at 4 16 35 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a29be108-afe0-40ed-b1f0-2851aef5efe9" />

Today’s algorithmic systems:

Maximize watch time, not satisfaction

Drive endless feeds

Create burnout and decision fatigue

Benefit platforms over people

## 🌱 The Shift: Bloom Scrolling

We are moving discovery from:
Reaction → Intention

From:
Algorithms watching behavior
To:
AI understanding people

We don’t serve feeds.
We serve people.


## 🧠 Our Solution: Conversational Discovery

Ads don’t interrupt.
They integrate.

We align brand discovery to:

User intent

Context

Content relevance

# We don’t sell attention.
**We enable discovery.**

## 🌍 Community Intelligence**

Discovery gets better when:

Friends recommend

Groups influence filtering

Influence becomes portable trust

Authority beats popularity

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Google Cloud

Gemini & Claude

Vector search

Open-source frameworks

Aura builder frontend


## 🧭 Vision

The future of media isn’t more content.
It’s better understanding.

We’re building a personal AI companion for content — not another scrolling platform.
